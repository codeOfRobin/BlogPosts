# Top 10 NBA Point Guards all-time

This is my list (after lots of deliberation) for the top 10 NBA Point Guards of all-time. There are many lists, but this one is mine.
1. Magic Johnson 
2. Stephen Curry (if he somehow beats the Lakers in the 2021 play-in, he might go #1 for me)
3. John Stockton
4. Chris Paul
5. Steve Nash
6. Isiah Thomas (Zeke)
7. Jason Kidd
8. Bob Cousy
9. Jerry West (Wikipedia lists him as a PG, I totally get the argument for him being an SG but then Steph should be an SG too by that metric)
10. Oscar Robertson, The Big-O

Honorary mentions: Walt Frazier (those 7 first defense all NBA teams are *not* a joke), Russel Westbrook (the upcoming 2021 play-in might eke him into the top 11), Nate “Tiny” Archibald, Derrick Rose, Tim Hardaway,  Dame Lillard, Chauncey Billups, Mark Price, Kyrie
