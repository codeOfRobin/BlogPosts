# Retrospectives

These are my notes from Jessie Link’s talk [https://youtu.be/UIU6P9HRYzo][2]. (she’s my boss’ boss’ boss, so there’s some _favoritism_ here.

# Trouble With Retros
- They get stale. It’s very easy to get caught in a “groundhog day” meeting where you’re constantly going over the same things over and over 
- People understand how to do them, they go through the motions of a retro but don’t understand why they’re doing them
- There’s an art to facilitating a group meeting, and often they’re poorly run
- Things don’t change/improve in a retro, lots of repetition, lots of the same points repeated over and over (see: groundhog day)
# Common Mistakes
- If you’re a TL facilitating a meeting, and you go in with an agenda to push. Retros are about the **team** , what’s bothering them and foremost a place for the **TEAM** to have input in improving their processes
- Dont’ have action items
- Bias into the sticky note process - if you say things out loud/in a public note taking space, teammates may not get a chance to speak their mind/ be afraid of contradicting someone
- Reading stickies one by one: you end up talking wayyyy too much about the first one, and then rushing through the others
- Worst case scenario: you stop doing retros or only do them in large emergency/crisis situations  
	![Waiting until an incident to do a retro is like waiting for your house to be on fire to install smoke detectors][image-1]
- Retros != post mortems
- Retros are important for building trust in the team, and to talk about feelings

# Use the right type of retro for your team
 - They’re like tools
- Use the clustering pattern:
	- Draw larger **patterns**
	- Echo effect: mirroring words builds empathy and understanding
	- Summarizing helps you talk to your teammates, shows that someone else has the same problem!
	- Draws deeper questions: we have an alerting/CI/infrastructure problem! 
	- What if you’re an outlier? - That’s ok too! 
# Retro #1 - The 4 Ls
- Liked, Lacked, Longed for, Learned
- Really meaty words, easy to respond to (what went wrong is a little judgy)
- Lacked = tactical, easy to fix (ex: a better laptop), process improvements
- Longed for = harder to fix (ex: CI architecture)
- Learned = great for a growth mindset
# Retro #2 -How did the sprint go?
- Draw the sprint!
- Struggle to articulate

- Breaks up monotony, fun activity
- Do it once a quarter
# Timeline of stickies
- ![][image-4]
- chronological timeline might bring up something important
# Gratitude
- no clustering
- just go around thanking people
# Draw a sailboat
- What drives you
- Anchors holding us back
- Hidden dangers - what could derail us?
- Promised Land - what does success look like?
- Very big picture
- Roadmaps, resets a team
