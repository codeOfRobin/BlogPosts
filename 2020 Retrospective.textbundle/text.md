# A 2020 Retrospective/Unhinged Rant

> Note: A lot of these opinions are strong-but-loosely-held kind 

2020‚Äôs been‚Ä¶..something. Between me moving cities and a new job, Kobe and Gigi üíî, the pandemic, the elections (and associated‚Ä¶.stuff) it‚Äôs been hard for everyone. I‚Äôve been reminiscing about life and stuff along the way and here‚Äôs some stuff on my mind/stuff I‚Äôve learnt:
- Living spaces matter _so much_. Being stuck in a 31 sq m studio that is 80% my bed messes with your head so much. I can‚Äôt wait to move to a bigger flat(soon hopefully ü§û)
- üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Manosphere twitter is a fucking mess and is turning peoples‚Äô brains to mush. I can‚Äôt believe how many friends I‚Äôve lost to this BS. It‚Äôs heartbreaking.
- M1 Macs are amazing, and have quickly become my favorite Apple product.
- This has been my first time investing _very_ small amounts of money in the stock market and I swear to god the stock market is foolish and barely has object permanence (see: [The McPlant Beyond Meat Saga][2]). To say that everyone looks like a genius in a bull market is an understatement.

	(this take aged well, given‚Ä¶.[ahem][4]
- Career stuff (these thoughts mostly flow linearly): 
	- One of the things I‚Äôve been seeing this year is the phenomenon of Indie devs burning out on their projects. This makes sense, software engineers do get burnt out working on the same thing for a long time (often spending 3-4 years full time being a CEO is exhausting), and this wasn‚Äôt completely unexpected given the first wave of indie devs are now 5-6 years in on their projects. Supporting software for a long time is _hard_. 
	- To that effect, I think I‚Äôm going to go slower on my indie app dreams. I have at least a few years before I try going indie but I do want to spent the next couple of years building the skills for my career. 
	- (I‚Äôm less sure of this given the amount of Ô£ø history I know) One of the most important things NeXT did was building the tech around `Foundation`, `AppKit`: core pieces that served Apple well for 20 years and beyond. I think I need to do something similar for my career.
	- For the near future that probably means getting _really_ good at [Elixir][5] and [React][6]. 
		- Why Elixir? Personally I do believe that people who care about  frontends write their own backends. Being able to control the server for your app opens up so many possibilities beyond what something like CloudKit can do
		- Why React? SwiftUI is _so bad right now_ if you want to right polished software. I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong most of Apple‚Äôs higher level UI frameworks are bad but SwiftUI is 10x Autolayout levels of janky right now and I like nice smooth things. I‚Äôll probably continue using Texture + IGListKit for a long time to come.
	-  This is a risky proposition, to say the least. I‚Äôm mostly ignoring SwiftUI as it matures and missing out on a lot of the cool stuff that the community is doing. But I‚Äôve done enough FOMOing for one career and this is my weird way to take a breather.
	- Consistently putting in work slowly has been great for me. Can you tell when my probation ended?

-  Work stuff:
	- Working at a large company is a very interesting experience. It‚Äôs a great place to build lots of expertise, have great teammates and not to mention gives a lot of psychological safety vs a startup (or god forbid, a startup within a startup) where you‚Äôre constantly in fight or flight mode.
	- One of my goals this year is to build a better relationship with my manager. I‚Äôve never been great at receiving feedback or generally working well with others and this is one of those things I need to get better at. I‚Äôm currently reading [No Hard Feelings][7] and [Julia Evans‚Äô excellent zine][8] on having a manager.   
- Stretch goals:
	- Read a little every day. Whether it‚Äôs a book or a WWDC video I think it‚Äôs important to keep getting better. To this end I‚Äôm blocking off an hour a day for this, starting tomorrow (at this point it‚Äôs the 26th of January lol)
- Personal stuff:
	- I‚Äôve been blocking off more video game time and honestly it‚Äôs been great for de-stressing after a long day or staying connected with friends. I‚Äôve gotten really good (or really bad depending on how you look at it) at COD and I‚Äôve done atleast one playthrough of Anthem.
