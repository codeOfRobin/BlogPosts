# A 2020 Retrsopective/unhinged rant

> Note: A lot of these opinions are strong-but-loosely-held kind 

2020’s been…..something. Between me moving cities and a new job, Kobe and Gigi 💔, the pandemic, the elections (and associated paraphernalia) it’s been hard for everyone. I’ve been reminiscing about life and stuff along the way and here’s some stuff on my mind/stuff I’ve learnt:
- Living spaces matter _so much_. Being stuck in a 31 sq m studio that is 80% my bed messes with your head so much. I can’t wait to move to a bigger flat(soon hopefully 🤞)
- 🙅‍♀️ Manosphere twitter is a fucking mess and is turning peoples’ brains to mush. I can’t believe how many friends I’ve lost to this BS. It’s heartbraking
- This has been my first time investing _very_ small amounts of money in the stock market and I swear to god the stock market is dumb and barely has object permanence (see: [The McPlant Beyond Meat Saga][2]). To say that everyone looks like a genius in a bull market is an understatement.

- Career stuff (these thoughts mostly flow linearly): 
	- One of the things I’ve been seeing this year is the phenomenon of Indie devs burning out on their projects. This makes sense, software engineers do get burnt out working on the same thing for a long time (often spending 3-4 years full time being a CEO is exhausting), and this wasn’t completely unexpected given the first wave of indie devs are now 5-6 years in on their projects. Supporting software for a long time is _hard_. 
	- To that effect, I think I’m going to go slower on my indie app dreams. I have atleast a few years before I try going indie but I do want to spent the next couple of years building the skills for my career. 
	- (I’m less sure of this given the amount of  history I know) One of the most important things Steve Jobs did at NeXT was building the tech around Foundation, AppKit: core pieces that served Apple well for 20 years and beyond. I think I need to do something similar for my career.
	- For the near future that probably means getting _really_ good at [Elixir][3] and [React][4]. 
		- Why Elixir? Personally I do believe that people who care about  frontends write their own backends. Being able to control the server for your app opens up so many possibilities beyond what something like CloudKit can do
		- Why React? SwiftUI is _so bad right now_ if you want to right polished software. I mean don’t get me wrong most of Apple’s higher level UI frameworks are bad but SwiftUI is 10x Autolayout levels of janky right now and I like nice smooth things. I’ll probably continue using Texture + IGListKit for a long time to come.
-  Work stuff:
	- Working at a large company is a very interesting experience. It’s a great place to build lots of expertise, have great teammates and not to mention gives a lot of psychological safety vs a startup (or god forbid, a startup within a startup) where you’re constantly in fight or flight mode.
	- One of my goals this year is to build a better relationship with my manager. I’ve never been great at receiving feedback or generally working well with others and this is one of those things I need to get better at. I’m currently reading [No Hard Feelings][5] and [Julia Evans’ excellent zine][6] on having a manager.
