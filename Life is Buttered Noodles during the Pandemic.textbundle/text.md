# Life is Buttered Noodles during the pandemic

CW: Feels.

Some background: the genesis of this post came from [this conversation][2] I had with one of the most coolest people I know on the internet.

Confession: this isn’t a recent phenomenon for me. Since basically May 2020, life has pretty much been buttered noodles in a lot of places, especially the media I consume.

What do I mean by Buttered Noodles? Some cultural context: Buttered Noodles is apparently a “basic” comfort food, liked mostly by children. Reference: [Abed in Community in this excellent BwB video][3]. And honestly, I’ve been liking _a lot_ of Buttered Noodles lately. With the world [plunged into eternal chaos][4] (CW: recent events) it’s been hard to follow things. It’s hard to appreciate fine plot lines or appreciate the details of a video game when we’re dealing with anxiety the likes we’ve never seen before. Suddenly, watching Brooklyn 99 or Ted Lasso or doing another round of Call of Duty feels much more relaxing than watching characters from all walks of life come together with grit and purpose through uncertain doom (that’s the plot of _The Wire_, right? I forget). Deep Stories and Art cedes its place to old favorites, artisaal Sourdough is replaced with ham and cheese sandwiches (I must be single-handedly supporting the local Pret in my area). Want to learn a new hobby? Sorry you’ll have to drag me out of bed before I finish my current comfortable routine of doomscrolling. Why finish a video game when you can stick around with those familiar characters _just a bit longer_? (See also: me preordering _Mass Effect: Legendary Edition_ even thought I’ve played the ever loving shit of that trilogy). Try out a new genre like Trap Sax? Nah, I got too much on my plate I want Jon Bon Jovi to tell me that [_Someday I’ll be Saturday Night_][5] )Why finish the book you’re reading, just to have your headcanon invalidated and have the character you ship end up with the wrong perosn(#BolinDeservesBetter). Procrastination is suddenly self-care. Change is _really fucking_ scary right now, especially with what’s happening every day. 

If you’re going through this right now, I want you to know I have a lot of empathy for you right now. I don’t know if we’re going to be permanently “broken”(as Christine put it), or if once this is over the skies will open and we’ll be back to our hipster selves. But gosh it’s going to be hard figuring out what to do with the mental space we had allocated for _checks notes_ everything.   
  
  
Hey, but atleast I don’t have to check the President’s Twitter every morning.
  
🤞
