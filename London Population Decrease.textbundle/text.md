# London’s population plunge during the pandemic

> A startling estimate has caught the eye of economists: that London's population may have plunged by 700,000 during the pandemic.
From a great thread by the Telegraph Business twitter account about the dramatic population fall in London. Can confirm this is the case, right now almost ½ of my team’s not in London in spite of working “from the London office”. I don’t know if this is permanent, but I do hope this brings down rents a little.
