# Beware the Gumroad Grifter

There’s…..(how do I say this) a whole bunch of [bad tweets by dumbass dudes on twitter these days][2]
- [I mean][3]
- [so, so][4]
- [many][5]

Sometimes they get [misogynistic][6], trashy and outright [dangerous][7]. 

The common denominator? They’re all selling you something: it used to be shady crap on paypal but now I guess they’re attracted to the slick UI on Gumroad to sell their 20 page PDFs on changing your life with a course or some malarkey like that.  And they _really_ need to continue new customer acquisition, so that takes the form of shitty tweets every week or so. I have most of them blocked, or sometimes their fragile egos can’t take a dunking and they block me first, but they do break my filters sometimes.

This stuff _always_ gets me mad, especially as someone who’s wanted to do indie things and write my own books. It’s like trying to sell your fresh fruit in a supermarket full of rotten fish. Honestly, [Podia][8] looks like a great alternative to someone like me right now, because honestly I’d never want to have my name next to these jerks. [An old Twitter thread about nazis and bars comes to mind whenever I make a decision like that][9]

Podia, if you’re listening “Don’t be a Gumroad Grifter, be a Podia Producer” sounds like a great tagline to me 👍
