# Beware the Gumroad Grifter

There’s…..(how do I say this) a whole bunch of [bad tweets by dumbass dudes on twitter these days][2]
- [I mean][3]
- [so, so][4]
- [many][5]

Sometimes they get [misogynistic][6], trashy and outright [dangerous][7]. 

The common denominator? They’re all selling you something: it used to be shady crap on PayPal but now I guess they’re attracted to the slick UI on Gumroad to sell their 20 page PDFs on changing your life with a course or some malarkey like that.  And they _really_ need to continue new customer acquisition, so that takes the form of shitty tweets every week or so. I guess getting a rise out of people gets engagement -\> a small percentage buy their snake oil -\> $$s.

Personally, I have most of them blocked, or sometimes their fragile egos can’t take a dunking and they block me first, but they do break my filters sometimes.

This stuff _always_ gets me mad, especially as someone who’s wanted to do indie things and write my own books. It’s like trying to sell your fresh fruit in a supermarket full of rotten fish(and for some reason, the fishmongers _really_ hate women, the LGBTQ community etc). Honestly for me right now, something like [Podia][8]  or rolling out my own [Stripe Checkout storefront][9] looks like a great alternative to someone like me right now, because honestly I’d never want to have my name next to these jerks. [An old Twitter thread about nazis and bars comes to mind whenever I think about platforms, communities and the like][10].

Podia, if you’re listening “Don’t be a Gumroad Grifter, be a Podia Producer” sounds like a great tagline to me 👋

Side note: they’re not all on Gumroad, some have the decency of buying their own domains. For some reason all of them do have a storefront there though. 🤔

Side Side note: this culture seems to have infected the [SaaS community][11] (some of these idiots don’t even go anon before posting their crap) too, and dear god I’m thankful I mostly deal with the indie iOS developer world.
