# The Mess We’re In by Joe Armstrong

These are my notes from Joe Armstrong (RIP 😢) ’s talk “The Mess We’re In”. Link [here][1] / [Youtube mirror][2]

(BTW, Joe uses Open Office, which is a surprise to me)

So, Joe runs into this bug in Open Office where it loses images. And he ran into incompatibilities in Keynote too (I assume this is Keynote ’09 vs modern Keynote).

— 
And so he tries this fancy thing that uses HTML for slides (and supposedly generates PDFs cos that’s important to him) and it asks if `grunt` is installed. (Remember [Grunt][3])?

— 

Machines today are 1000x faster than they were. But they don’t boot 1000x faster as an example. What went wrong?
