# Phoenix `mix.new` options

I was looking at what `mix phx.new` does in its setup process for my new project. I was unsure how easy itâ€™d be to start without Ecto and HTML since itâ€™s mostly an API to work with (and Iâ€™d like to think about how itâ€™ll be possible to add in the future).

Soâ€¦..how does one figure that out? I donâ€™t want to know what specific lines in files change, but hereâ€™s how Iâ€™d do that if I wanted to:
1. Create and initialize a git repo: `git init`
2. Run `mix phx.new something --no-ecto --no-html`
3. Commit
4. `rm -rf something && mix phx.new something`
5. Do a `git dfif`

But for just the files added, you can run those two commands, and diffing those two gives us the files that changed:

So it looks like itâ€™s a bunch of view files, the `PageController` (and associated views/templates), `repo` and `migrations` folders.


Strangely enough the assets remain in both runs ðŸ¤” (This is probably for stuff like the `/dashboard` routes
